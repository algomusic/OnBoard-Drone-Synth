The OnBoard Drone Synth is a DIY synthesizer that enables the performance of up to 5 independent voices. Each voice is monophonic with controls over pitch, release time, detune, timbre, pitch wander, vibrato, pulsing amplitude variation, and volume level. The stereo output from all voices is passed through overdrive, filter, two independent delays with cross modulation, and reverb. Sonically, the Drone Synth embraces the post digital and somewhat gritty aesthetic of DIY audio culture.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e8ad3b-7b5e-4afc-b0a5-d58973b2c4b5)
